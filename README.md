## 🧠 Game Rules

- The goal is to reach **21** or come closer to it than the dealer **without going over**.
- Both player and dealer are dealt **2 cards** initially.
- You can choose to **HIT** (draw more cards) or **STAND**.
- If your total exceeds **21**, you **bust** and lose the bet.
- Dealer must hit until their total is **17 or higher**.
- A Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) pays **3:2**.
- If both have the same value, it’s a **tie** (no money exchange).
